👋 Hi, I'm Lucille Jordaan.

👀 I’m interested in web design, data analytics, and data science.

🌱 I’m currently a Coding Mentor / Code Reviewer with HyperionDev, focusing on Python, Django, Flask, HTML, and CSS.

💡 I specialize in data analysis and insights generation, combining my skills in Django and Flask to create exciting web applications that integrate data-driven functionalities.

💼 My experience spans various sectors, including FMCG and Agri-tech, where I've worked on projects involving customer satisfaction, logistics, imports, exports, plant/animal disease classifications, soil studies, wildlife monitoring, and agronomy GIS applications.
